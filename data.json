This is earlier than I would normally be up, but since my parents are early risers, I wasn't going to argue. After my Mom looked at the menus of a couple of places that had generally positive reviews (she's allergic to milk, so we like to make sure she has plenty of choices before going somewhere, more on that later), we settled on Sunnyside.\n\nOur group of six was seated immediately upon entry, presumably due to the fact that it was still so early. It definitely got busier as time went on, although by the time we left (around 10:30), there were still some empty tables. The service was fast and friendly, and our coffee cups never sat empty for long. The food itself was delicious, and the portions were substantial - great value for the price! I ordered an omelette and I felt satisfied upon finishing it, a good sign considering my voracious appetite.\n\nWhen my Mom notified our server about her allergy, she was told that they usually cook with some type of oil/grease that contains dairy (I can't remember the name of it), but the server indicated they'd have no trouble accommodating her restriction. When our food arrived, my Mom noticed that her meal wasn't as hot as she would've liked, presumably due to the fact that the cooks prepared her plate in advance of the rest of us. I also noticed that other people, who were seated and ordered after us, received their food before we did. I'm not sure if this is considered a faux pas, but when I worked in a restaurant, we made absolutely sure to avoid doing this. If it weren't for these two minor complaints (and moreso the first one), I might have given the place 5 stars, and if I could, I'd probably rate it 4.5 rather than 4.\n\nI could definitely see myself returning, and won't hesitate to recommend this spot to anyone else!"},{"b_name":"Sunnyside Grill","b_stars":3.5,"b_review_count":39,"id":"48NB2Mu_e8Ff3l1E9VobjQ","name":"Dale","neighborhood":"Corso Italia","address":"1218 Saint Clair Avenue W","city":"Toronto","state":"ON","postal_code":"M6E","latitude":43.6778,"longitude":-79.4447,"stars":1,"review_count":8,"is_open":1,"yelping_since":"2015-02-23T08:00:00.000Z","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"average_stars":2,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"business_id":"--DaPTJW3-tB1vP-PfdTEg","user_id":"o4pLK9wtkwM1cd2rTPGLFw","date":"2015-06-12T07:00:00.000Z","text":"Visited for brunch at about 11 a.m. on June 12th.

Not once did the server come back and ask if everything was ok or even refill our coffee and water. \n\nAs for the food. We both ordered the all day breakfast and it was horrible. The potatoes were not cooked and soaked in grease. The eggs were ok but so oily and greasy."},{"b_name":"Sunnyside Grill","b_stars":3.5,"b_review_count":39,"id":"yVfauiuH7pGmn56SLjQrUw","name":"Vince N.","neighborhood":"Corso Italia","address":"1218 Saint Clair Avenue W","city":"Toronto","state":"ON","postal_code":"M6E","latitude":43.6778,"longitude":-79.4447,"stars":3,"review_count":9,"is_open":1,"yelping_since":"2011-01-06T08:00:00.000Z","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"average_stars":2.89,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"business_id":"--DaPTJW3-tB1vP-PfdTEg","user_id":"04ehylWcAs9w1Wy-JUrl6Q","date":"2016-10-02T07:00:00.000Z","text":"Two of us went for a late brunch and were not disappointed. Service was prompt; waitress was courteous. She brought rye toast instead of wholewheat but I kept it anyway; she offered to replace it. \n\nA cook/chef came from the back to apologize to the guests at the table next to us who were waiting about 15mins; the staff had somehow lost the slip with their original order. I thought that was very good; usually the wait staff are the ones to do that kinda dirty work. \n\nI'll certainly go back another day."},{"b_name":"Sunnyside Grill","b_stars":3.5,"b_review_count":39,"id":"_HY2yoOUbe13yw7PYFs8gg","name":"Marie","neighborhood":"Corso Italia","address":"1218 Saint Clair Avenue W","city":"Toronto","state":"ON","postal_code":"M6E","latitude":43.6778,"longitude":-79.4447,"stars":5,"review_count":7,"is_open":1,"yelping_since":"2017-01-23T08:00:00.000Z","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0,"fans":0,"average_stars":3.43,"compliment_hot":0,"compliment_more":0,"compliment_profile":0,"compliment_cute":0,"compliment_list":0,"compliment_note":0,"compliment_plain":0,"compliment_cool":0,"compliment_funny":0,"compliment_writer":0,"compliment_photos":0,"business_id":"--DaPTJW3-tB1vP-PfdTEg","user_id":"gi7nOGT7lrJRdcmgcSvjqA","date":"2017-05-02T07:00:00.000Z","text":"Love the breakfast here and the pancakes!
